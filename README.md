# Bayesian Profile Regression applied to a Population-scale Dataset to Identify Clusters of Multiple Long-Term Conditions

This repository contains code used to do the analysis in the paper "Bayesian Profile Regression applied to a Population-scale Dataset to Identify Clusters of Multiple Long-Term Conditions."

Results of simulation studies can be seen directly in `PR.ipynb`. This notebook uses data simulation code from `data_gen.py` and model specification and fitting code from `models.py`. The code in `models.py` was also used for data analysis inside the [SAIL databank](https://saildatabank.com/). `SAIL_post_processing.ipynb` contains plots generated from results of analysis performed inside SAIL.
